## About Us
We are a community-based FRC team formed to provide FRC opportunities to private homeschool students in Northern San Diego County, CA. Formed in Fall 2017 from one private homeschool student with prior FRC experience and a handful of others about to (or having just) aged out of FLL, this team is beginning to learn about the FRC environment and development tools. As with most homeschooling families, the team member parents are actively engaged in supporting the learning experience through both coaching in life skills (e.g. communication, scheduling, task breakdown) and technical expertise and/or resources (e.g. git, software/hardware development skills, collaboration tools, hosting a website, helping us become a non-profit organization).

'''
NOTE: Because we are a community-based team and not associated with an academic institution we may not qualify for a GitHub-sponsored team account.  If that happens then we will probably relocate our repositories and Wikis elsewhere.

## Repository Purpose
This repository is intended to provide a Wiki of our discoveries, decisions, and possible future direction for general topics that other teams may find useful. This is **not** intended to capture issues or insights about a particular challenge or our strategies and solutions for a particular season.

## Other Repositories
Separate repositories are used for each competition season, pre-season activities, investigations/developments, and for change control of our website.

## Other Resources
Team calendars, internal communications, business information, and mechanical design files are kept in Google Drive.
